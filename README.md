# Introduction to Datascience 2019 Project
## [Kaggle Competition - Nomad2018 Predicting Transparent Conductors](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nomad2018-predict-transparent-conductors/)

Transparent, conductive materials are a unique class of compounds, which have both: electrical conductivity and low absorbance in the visible range. These materials can be used in a large number of applications such as energy-conserving windows and solar cells.In spite of appealing properties relatively low number of compounds possess such properties. As the number of possible materials is large, to select compounds for experimental verification, computational screening of candidates is necessary. Lowering the cost of screening and increasing its accuracy,  would benefit the discovery of these materials by reducing the development costs. 

Using machine learning methods we have estimated the band gap and formation energy of materials. The models were trained using attributes, which describe the symmetry of crystal combined with qualities that describe crystalâ€™s chemical environment.

In addition to SKLearn, Pandas, MatPlotLib and NumPy the project uses Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) python package
